# NUKE Build System Migration Summary

## Overview

Successfully migrated the GetSecure .NET project from shell scripts to the NUKE build automation system. This provides a more robust, cross-platform, and maintainable build process.

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Build System Migration
- **Replaced shell scripts** with NUKE targets
- **Updated Build.cs** with comprehensive targets for all build operations
- **Fixed solution file** with proper GUIDs for all projects
- **Added GitVersion support** for automatic versioning (with fallback configuration)

### ✅ Package Management
- **Created NuGet packages** for both GetSecure.Core and GetSecure.CLI
- **Configured package publishing** with NUKE targets
- **Set up proper versioning** using GitVersion (when working)
- **Generated packages** in `output/packages/` directory

### ✅ Build Targets Available
- `Clean` - Removes build artifacts and output directories
- `Restore` - Restores NuGet packages
- `Compile` - Builds the solution (default target)
- `Test` - Runs all unit tests
- `Pack` - Creates NuGet packages
- `Publish` - Publishes packages to NuGet.org (requires API key)
- `Full` - Runs Clean, Test, and Pack in sequence
- `CI` - Alias for Full (intended for CI/CD pipelines)

### ✅ Configuration Files Added
- `global.json` - .NET SDK version specification
- `GitVersion.yml` - Git-based versioning configuration
- `nuke-config.json` - NUKE build configuration
- `BUILD.md` - Comprehensive build documentation

## Usage Examples

### Basic Commands
```bash
# Build the solution
./build.sh Compile

# Run tests
./build.sh Test

# Create packages
./build.sh Pack

# Full build (clean, test, pack)
./build.sh Full
```

### Publishing Packages
```bash
# Publish to NuGet.org (requires API key)
./build.sh Publish --nuget-api-key YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Package Output

The build system successfully creates NuGet packages:
- `GetSecure.Core.1.0.0.nupkg` - Core library package
- `GetSecure.CLI.1.0.0.nupkg` - CLI application package

## Migration Benefits

1. **Cross-platform compatibility** - Works on Windows, Linux, and macOS
2. **Better dependency management** - Automatic package restoration and versioning
3. **Integrated testing** - Built-in test execution with results reporting
4. **Package publishing** - Automated NuGet package creation and publishing
5. **CI/CD ready** - Designed for continuous integration pipelines
6. **Maintainable** - C#-based build scripts with IntelliSense support

## Known Issues

1. **GitVersion warnings** - GitVersion has issues with the current branch structure, but this doesn't affect the build process
2. **System.CommandLine beta dependency** - CLI project uses a beta version of System.CommandLine, which generates warnings

## Next Steps

1. **Publish packages to NuGet.org** when ready for release
2. **Set up CI/CD pipeline** using the `CI` target
3. **Add more build targets** as needed (e.g., code coverage, documentation generation)
4. **Fix GitVersion configuration** if automatic versioning is desired

## Files Modified/Created

### Modified Files
- `build/Build.cs` - Complete rewrite with comprehensive targets
- `build/_build.csproj` - Added necessary NUKE packages
- `GetSecure.sln` - Fixed GUIDs for all projects
- `sdk/GetSecure.Core/GetSecure.Core.csproj` - Removed hardcoded versions
- `sdk/GetSecure.CLI/GetSecure.CLI.csproj` - Removed hardcoded versions
- `README.md` - Added build system documentation

### New Files
- `global.json` - .NET SDK version management
- `GitVersion.yml` - Git versioning configuration
- `nuke-config.json` - NUKE configuration
- `BUILD.md` - Build system documentation
- `quick-start.sh` - Quick start script
- `MIGRATION_SUMMARY.md` - This summary

## Conclusion

The migration to NUKE build system is complete and successful. The project now has a modern, robust build automation system that replaces the previous shell scripts with a more maintainable and feature-rich solution.
